        <li>Any kind of sauce you want. MEATBALL IS NOT A SAUCE DIAOLO CAN</li>
        <li>Add as much grana padano grattuggiato as you want, regardless of the sauce.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4><strong>Preparation:</strong></h4>

    <ol>
        <li>Cook the spaghetti. You know, put them in salted water and wait 10 minutes...</li>
        <li>On a separate pan, heat or cook the sauce.</li>
        <li>Let the spaghetti and the sauce make love for some time in the same pan. You can watch them, we know you like it... </li>
        <li>Help them climax by adding some friction bewtween them, i.e. slap them with the finest spatula you have.</li>
